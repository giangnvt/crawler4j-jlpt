Noun + 中
When 中 is attached to some Nouns it’s pronounced as “chuu” while to others it’s pronounced as “juu.” There’s no specific rule so you’ll need to learn by heart.
When attached to some certain Nouns, 中 can be pronounced as both chuu and juu. For example:
世界中 (sekaichuu/seikaijuu): around the world
年中 (nenchuu/nenjuu): whole year, all year round
